I'm **HyunJin KIM**.  
I'm studying to become a web developer using JAVA.  
The meaning of **"The Kim's"** is that things I studied are being recorded here, so I took my last name, meaning that they are mine.

- :briefcase: Front-End / Back-End / Full-Stack
- :muscle: Passionate / Interesting / Keep Learning
- :mortar_board: Bachelor of Computer Software Science

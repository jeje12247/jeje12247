 ### :wave: Hi, there!

I'm HyunJin KIM.   

I'm studying to become a web developer using JAVA.   
The meaning of **"The Kim's"** is that things I studied are being recorded here, so I took my last name, meaning that they are mine.

- :computer: Junior Developer

- :mag: Looking for a job

- :briefcase: Front-End / Back-End / Full-Stack

- :muscle: Passionate / Interesting / Keep Learning

- :mortar_board: Bachelor of Computer Software Science

- :pencil2: Educational student of Employment Academy (for 5 months)

-  :swimming_woman: I enjoy swimming, reading books. :book:

- :bulb: It's fun to develop what I want, and I hope to see the web I made used by the public.
